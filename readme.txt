Vim navigation in windows:

Load this file with autohotkeys. On first load, run the registry edit at the bottom of this .atk file (that's commented out) in a new .atk file. This will keep your computer from locking when you press WIN+l. That's all!

Controls:

WIN+h: left
WIN+j: down
WIN+k: up
WIN+l: right

WIN+shift+(h,j,k or l): move while highlighting text

WIN+control+(h,j,k or l): move while skipping from word to word

WIN+control+shift+(h,j,k or l): move while skipping from word to word, and highlighting text

WIN+space: move down 6 lines
WIN+shift+space: move up 6 lines
